# Clean CSV 
Cleans a CSV file by removing rows with empty entries and removing excess whitespace.

# Instructions
Run the script with the name of the csv file you want to use as an argument:
```
python main.py "file_name"
```

For example with the provided imdb_data.csv use:
```
python main.py imdb_data.csv
```
It will create a new file called imdb_data_clean.csv with the cleaned information.
